## 1.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 9575d9c: A deadlock can occur when `AttestationTrustManagerGA` is initialized and a request to get the
  attestation doc from the enclave are made simultaneously. This is dues to the modification of the
  `SSLContext` when a request is made which would lead to a read timeout in OkHTTP Client.

  - [3a93fedf814c37ed698fa46432e758ac4f3bd885](https://github.com/evervault/evervault-android/commit/3a93fedf814c37ed698fa46432e758ac4f3bd885):
    `enclavesTrustManager` will block to initialize the cache before modifying the
    `AttestationTrustManagerGA` and subsequently the `SSLContext`
  - The polling logic has been changed to delay before populating the cache to prevent duplicate requests
  - `get()` calls to the cache are now always synchronous as it is not called from a coroutine.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- cb51dea: fix: A bug exists with slower network connectivity that can cause an encryption to fail. This will result
  in a card being marked as valid as the card number is valid. Explit empty checks are not performed before
  the card is returned from the card component.
  feat: implement new CardNumberField for control over onNext capability. When using a CardNumberField without
  CVC or expiry expose the onNext function to control the focus behaviour of the compose component.
